      {/*  Upfinity Upfinity was founded on September 21st 2021 with the goal of creating a fun and innovative ecosystem where all aspects are built with community rewards in mind. We noticed that there were very meme ecosystems or very serious ones, but not one that incorporated the best of both worlds and we wanted to always reward our community for choosing us over everything out there. But being fun and innovative wasn¡¯t enough for us, that¡¯s why our token is powered by a unique smart contract with the capacity to adapt. It is possible for us to add and implement any new trends immediately, allowing our community to benefit from whatever is hot on blockchain at the moment. Gamified and innovative tokenomics, NFTs with utilities, play to earn games, all sort of launchpads, a metaverse, you name it, we have or will have it. The Upfinity metaverse Intro: Upfinity was a tech company that through R&D discovered how to control nuclear fusion and later on how to manufacture micro size reactors, making unlimited energy with 0 emissions a reality. From coffee machines to whole cities, everything is powered by Upfinity¢â reactors.*/}
