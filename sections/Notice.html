<!-- (Find 'UpFinity' in <a href="https://www.dessertswap.finance/dessertdoxxed.html">DessertDoxxed</a>) -->
<!-- Put your trust in me that there will be no scams or rug pulled with UpFinity. -->

<!-- I have applied many <span>new</span> unique features in this token. -->
<!-- I have many innovative plans that I will implement into UpFinity’s smart contract. -->
<!-- So I have decided to make this contract <span>UPGRADABLE.</span> -->
<!-- Which means the contract can be <span>modified.</span> -->

<!-- Some investors may worry that since this contract is modifiable, -->
<!-- there might be a <span>malicious</span> intent on my part.  -->
<!-- Such as taking all the funds and money into my own pocket, etc. -->
<!-- I will not say that this is impossible. Simply because; it is possible. -->
<!-- But I will say that, <span>I will NEVER do that.</span> -->
<!-- I am hoping, that by me being <span>DOXXED</span> will build trust and support within the UpFinity community. -->

<!-- Please look at my suggested new unique features and smart contract functionalities. -->
<!-- And please ask yourself, <span>HOW CAN A SCAMMER THINK OF ALL THESE THINGS?</span> -->
<!-- Scammers usually only copy another meme token's Smart Contract or honeypot. -->
<!-- That is enough for them because it gives much money. -->
<!-- Think of all those scam coins start and run. -->

<!-- I have not done that, I have created a <span>new</span> generation Smart Contract -->
<!-- I have done something extremely unique with UpFinity’s Smart Contract. -->
<!-- I have deployed a contract that allows for updated features without the need of a V2 token. -->
<!-- This makes this contract truly upgradable. -->

<!-- Also, please consider the <span>potential</span> of my upcoming new unique features. -->
<!-- Big or small, new or not, I have already created 6 of them. -->
<!-- And I have about 10 more to be applied. -->
<!-- including concepts, there is <span>much more.</span> -->
<!-- Moreover, as time passes, I will invent more features. -->

<!-- And there will be a new feature suggested by other token in future. -->
<!-- By upgrade, it could be applied to this token too. -->

<!-- It makes the token more stable because if there should be a minor issue or something, -->
<!-- a simple upgrade can fix it very well. -->

<!-- Finally, have you ever seen a <span>voluntarily announce</span> that the token could be scammed, -->
<!-- and explaining all of these in such a long text? -->
<!-- <span>Never.</span> They <span>hide</span> until revealed by someone. -->
<!-- And if it is revealed, they just ban or ignore with no explanation and just shill until rugpull. -->

<!-- This is all I could explain for the upgradable Smart Contract. -->
<!-- I hope you are persuaded and convinced that it is <span>SAFU.</span> -->
<!-- I will make multiple transparent process to convince you more. -->
<!-- (link for the upgrade process) -->

<!-- Thank you :) -->
<!-- 고맙습니다 :)</p> -->
