    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Why I made this token</p>
  </div>
  <p style="white-space: pre-line;text-align: center;">I have seen many tokens that have been successful with adding new unique feature.
Some features like redistribution, auto-liquidity.
Other tokens applied those features later but usually first ones win at last.

So I have focused on the <span>NEW UNIQUE FEATURE</span>.
What will make people buy and hold and make the token and community grow?
Based on this question, I have invented <span>MANY</span> new unique features.
And I have tried to select the best one among them.

During the selection, I have thought of that,
How about adding <span>ALL</span> of them in a <span>SINGLE</span> token?

Each feature is very new and unique. It will attract many people.
Adding all of them in a single token will make the token more attractive.
And 'all of them in a single token' itself can be a another unique concept.
